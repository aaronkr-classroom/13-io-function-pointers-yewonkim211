 I seek the means to fight injustice. To turn fear against those who prey on the fearful. I'm Batman No guns, no killing. I will go back to Gotham and I will fight men Iike this but I will not become an executioner.

 It's ends here. Does it come in black? I will go back to Gotham and I will fight men Iike this but I will not become an executioner.

 No guns, no killing. My anger outweights my guilt. It was a dog. It was a big dog. Well, you see... I'm buying this hotel and setting some new rules about the pool area.

 Bats frighten me. It's time my enemies shared my dread. Does it come in black?
